# Art-By-Code
Idk man I was bored.

A collection (maybe, currently I've only done one) of different programming "art".
I've always wanted to make things like this but never really felt creative enough.
Fianlly I gave it a shot and my first one turned out... okay? I like it at least and I had fun making it.

## Where to find the projects

Check out the first project "Colors and Sound" (I know, very unique) [here](https://jakatut.github.io/Art-By-Code/)

In the future I'll create a "portfolio" site for these little things.

## Controlls

A => Change direction to the left.
D => Change direction to the right.

Click => start a tone
Click + Drag => draw

Try changing the directions left and right while clicking and dragging!
